# The first value in the sequence will be 60 assigned to kph. 
# Notice the third argument specifies 10 as the step value. 
# This means the numbers in the list will be 60, 70, 80, and so forth. 
# The second argument specifies 131 as the sequenceâ€™s ending limit, 
# so the last number in the sequence will be 130.
